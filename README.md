## Overview

This repository contains the dotfiles I generally use on various systems.

Keeping them in a git repository makes syncing across multiple systems much more easier. For more information, see [GitHub ❤ ~/](http://dotfiles.github.io/)

## Installation

Installation is pretty straight-forward: either check out the repository into a folder and cherry-pick the settings in my dotfiles, or just run `./install.sh`.
