## Overview

This repository contains the dotfiles which I sync and use across my computers and servers.

Keeping them in a git repository makes syncing them across multiple systems much more easier. For more information, see [GitHub ❤ ~/](http://dotfiles.github.io/)

## Installation

Installation is pretty straight-forward: Either check out the repository into a folder, and cherry-pick the settings in my dotfiles, or just check out the repository to your home (~) folder.

If you choose to checkout the repository into a sub-folder, you can then just symlink the dotfiles you choose into your home folder.
